## How to use
Open a terminal and type
```pwsh
path/to/WayNetConverter.exe path/to/file.zen
```
This will write the waypoints in _file_.wp and the freepoints in _file_.fp.

Alternatively you can just drag & drop the .zen file over the .exe.

Note that the .zen has to be in ASCII form - binary .zen files aren't supported yet.
